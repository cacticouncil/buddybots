NOTES FOR MOD USERS:
====================

- It is recommended that any user modifications that have been installed to the Doom3 
directory be removed before installing this Expansion. These modifications are not 
supported by Activision(r) and may not be compatible with some of the new features that 
are included.


2.  CD Key

A. Installation and the CD Key

At the start of the install of the Expansion Pack, a valid Resurrection of Evil CD key must be entered.  As is the standard, the CD key can be found on the inside of the jewel case.

B. The game tells me my CD key is invalid:

The number one problem with CD keys is mistyping.  Double and triple check the 
characters you have entered.

C. Some common sense about your CD key:

Each CD key is unique - protect it from loss or theft by keeping a copy of it in a safe 
place.  Without it, you cannot reinstall the game or play online.  You may hear of 
so-called "CD Key generators" being available for illicit download on the Internet.  
They do not work as advertised, and often attempt to steal legitimate keys off your 
computer, reveal personal information or install viruses, worms and/or trojan horses 
on your machine.  Do not download and/or use them under any circumstances.

3.  DirectX(r) Detection & Installation

The DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil installer does not check for the version of 
DirectX(r) you have currently installed, it just prompts you to install DirectX(r) 9.0c.
Activision recommends allowing the installer to proceed with the DirectX(r) 9.0c 
installation, even if you think you may have 9.0c installed.  Re-installing 
DirectX(r) 9.0c will not harm your DirectX(r) configuration.  
DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil requires DirectX(r) 9.0c to install and play.

4. Windows(r) Installer Updates

The Windows(r) Installer may need to be updated.  If this is the case, the 
DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil installer will update the Windows(r) Installer, reboot 
the machine, then continue normally.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. Video Issues
Please note that DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil will automatically configure optimal 
video settings based on your computer's hardware.  If your hardware changes after 
install or if you wish to rescan, in the Main Menu: click OPTIONS, SYSTEM, then click 
the SCAN HARDWARE AND SELECT OPTIMAL VIDEO QUALITY button, then APPLY CHANGES. Any 
change in Screen Size and some advanced options requires you to quit and restart 
DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil for them to take effect. 

A. Latest drivers required

For best performance and video quality, please make sure you have the latest drivers 
for your video card when running DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil.  If you have an ATI 
or NVIDIA video card, you can find drivers on their websites.
http://www.ati.com/
http://www.nvidia.com/


B. Disabling video options to gain performance:

In addition to setting Low Quality, disabling Specular, Bump Maps, and Shadows will 
help improve performance. These can be disabled under the ADVANCED OPTIONS of the 
SYSTEM menu. Please note that while increasing performance, disabling these options 
turns off graphical features that are key in the DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil 
experience.

C. The game cannot run windowed mode in 16-bit desktop color.

If you wish to run DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil in a window then your desktop color
depth must be set to 32-bits or higher.  DOOM 3 cannot run in a window while the
desktop is running 16-bits.


2. Sound Issues

A. Latest drivers required

Please make sure you have the latest drivers for your sound card when running 
DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil.


3. Multiplayer and Internet issues
Please note that Internet play requires a broadband connection and latest drivers.

A. Internet listen server vs dedicated server:
   
Hosting a listen server over the Internet is more taxing on your system than a 
dedicated server. Server performance will improve with dedicated servers when 
hosting on the Internet. 

B. Dedicated servers crash on machines with 384mb of RAM.

If you have dedicated server stability issues running on a machine with 384mb of RAM, 
try first starting a listen server, disconnecting, then starting a dedicated server.  
If problems persist try rebooting your machine and repeating those steps.

C.  Problems Finding Internet Games

If you are having problems seeing servers in the Multiplayer Game Browser screen, 
please make sure that you have checked the following before contacting customer 
support.

1) Make sure that you are connected to the Internet (through either a Local Area 
Network, Cable Modem, DSL Modem etc.).  You must connect to the Internet before 
starting the game.

2) Once you have connected to the Internet and started DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil, 
click "Multiplayer", then "Find A Multiplayer Game".  In the "Game Browser" menu make 
sure "Internet" is selected. Click on "Get New List". 


NOTE:  Activision Customer Support does not support playing multiplayer through 
firewalls or shared connections.

4. Operating system specific issues

A.  Shift Key in Windows(r) 2000/XP Interrupts Game

If you press the Shift key 5 times consecutively in Windows(r) 2000 or Windows(r) XP 
the following message should appear:

"By pressing the SHIFT key five times you have turned on the StickyKeys feature in 
Windows(r) 2000 [or Windows(r) XP].  With this feature, you can lock down the 
CTRL, ALT, or SHIFT keys.  This is useful if you are unable to hold down more than 
one key at a time."

Click OK to turn this feature on.  If you do not want to use the feature, click Cancel.

To avoid this happening in the future, click the Settings button on the window 
referenced above.  When the accessibility options screen appears, click the 
"Settings" button in the "Sticky Keys" portion of the window.  On the next window 
(should be labeled "Settings For Sticky Keys"), uncheck in the box that says, 
"Use shortcut," then click on "Apply," and close the windows.  The problem should 
not occur once the shortcut has been disabled.

B.  Windows(r) Key Interrupts Game in 2000/XP

If the Windows(r) key is pressed during game play, the Start Menu will interrupt 
the game.  Should this happen, simply press the Escape (Esc) key to close the menu 
and return to the game.  Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent this from 
happening again except by being careful not to hit those keys while playing.

C.  Game Icons Are Missing From Start Menu And/Or Desktop In Windows(r) 2000/XP

When installing DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil while logged into Windows(r) as a 
specific user, the game icons will only show up when logging in as that user.  
For example, if you log into Windows(r) as "Joeuser", install the game, then log 
out and log back in as "Janeuser", the game icons will not show up.  If you wish 
to play the game, make sure you log into Windows(r) as the same user you were logged 
in as when you installed the game.

D.  Admin Rights Needed To Load and Play On Windows(r) 2000 or XP

If you are running Windows(r) 2000 or Windows(r) XP, you must have Administrator 
rights to properly install and play the game.
