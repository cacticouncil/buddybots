<P>It has been almost two years since the mysterious incident shut down the UAC base on Mars. Several months ago, one of the UAC satellites still monitoring the red planet detected a beacon originating from Site 1. This early research facility was long forgotten, even before the invasion. Now, you're a Marine combat engineer, part of a massive research and security team lead by Dr. Elizabeth McNeil. Your team is being sent back to Mars in an attempt to find and investigate the source of this strange signal. What you'll find, nobody knows, but hopefully it will offer new insight into the ancient civilization that once inhabited Mars.</P>
<P>As your transport nears the surface, you cannot help but wonder what type of "accident" could have killed so many two years ago... and could it happen again?</P>

Site 1 was abandoned years ago, and there may be additional useful and powerful weapons left behind by the previous team.  </P>

<P>DOOM3&trade;: Resurrection of Evil&trade; multiplayer allows up to eight players to compete in Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Last Man Standing and Tournament---and the all-new Capture The Flag mode.</P>

<h2 id="page14">Deathmatch</h2>
<P>An every-marine-for-himself slugfest. If you're the marine with the most kills when time runs out, you win. </P>
<h2 id="page15">Team Deathmatch</h2>
<P>Pair-up and compete to be the team with the most kills before time runs out. </P>

<P>Each marine has a limited number of lives. If all others have fallen and you're the last marine standing, you win.</P>
<h2 id="page17">Tournament</h2>
<P>Two marines battle one-on-one while others watch and wait as spectators. When the battle's over, the first spectator in line becomes the new opponent while the loser moves to the end of the spectator line. The victor remains in the combat arena until defeated by another marine. </P>
<h2 id="pageXP1">Capture The Flag</h2>
<P>Two teams of up to four players try to take the other team's flag to their own base, while keeping the opposition from doing the same. Your flag must be on its stand to score.</P>

The Software, the Printed Materials, and all copyrights, trademarks, and all other conceivable intellectual property rights related to the Software and the Printed Materials are owned by Id Software and are protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty provisions, and all applicable law, such as the Lanham Act. You must treat the Software and the Printed Materials like any other copyrighted material, as required by 17 U.S.C. &sect; 101 <I>et seq.</I> and other applicable law. You agree to use your best efforts to see that any user of the Software licensed hereunder, the Printed Materials or the New Creations complies with this Agreement. You agree that you are receiving a copy of the Software and the Printed Materials by limited license only and not by sale and that the "first sale" doctrine of 17 U.S.C. &sect; 109 does not apply to your receipt or use of the Software or the Printed Materials. This Section shall survive the cancellation or termination of this Agreement.</P>
<P align=justify></P><B>
<P align=justify>7. NO ID SOFTWARE WARRANTIES.</B> <B>ID SOFTWARE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, THE PRINTED MATERIALS, THE SOFTWARE IMAGES, AND OTHERWISE.

<P align=justify>8. Limited Activision Warranty.</B> Activision warrants to the original consumer purchaser of the Software that the recording medium on which the Software is recorded will be free from defects in material and workmanship for ninety (90) days from the date of purchase. If the recording medium is found defective within ninety (90) days of original purchase, Activision agrees to replace, free of charge, any Software discovered to be defective within such period upon its receipt of the Software, postage paid, with the proof of the date of purchase, as long as the Software still is being manufactured by Activision. In the event that the Software no longer is available, Activision retains the right to substitute a similar game program of equal or greater value. This warranty is limited to the recording medium containing the Software as originally provided by Activision and is not applicable to normal wear and tear.

Governing Law, Venue, Indemnity, and Liability Limitation.</B> This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the applicable laws of the State of Texas (but excluding conflicts of laws principles) and applicable United States federal law. Except as set forth below, exclusive venue for all litigation regarding this Agreement shall be in Dallas County, Texas, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in Dallas County, Texas, for any such litigation. Exclusive venue for all litigation involving Activision, but not involving Id Software, with regard to this Agreement shall be in Los Angeles County, California, and you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Los Angeles, California, for any such litigation.

You agree that your unauthorized use of the Software Images, the Printed Materials, or the Software, or any part thereof, immediately and irreparably may damage Id Software such that Id Software could not be adequately compensated solely by a monetary award, and in such event, at Id Software's option, that Id Software shall be entitled to an injunctive order, in addition to all other available remedies, including a monetary award, to prohibit such unauthorized use without the necessity of Id Software posting bond or other security. <B>IN ANY CASE, ID SOFTWARE, ACTIVISION, AND ID SOFTWARE AND ACTIVISION'S RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, REPRESENTATIVES, AGENTS, LICENSEES (EXCLUDING YOU), SUB-LICENSEES (EXCLUDING YOU), SUCCESSORS, AND ASSIGNS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM ANY ALLEGED CLAIM FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY EVEN IF ID SOFTWARE, ACTIVISION, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENT(S) HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES, OR EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE, OR LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.</B> Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

<P align=justify>11. General Provisions.</B> Neither this Agreement nor any part or portion hereof shall be assigned or sublicensed by you.

Should any provision of this Agreement be held to be void, invalid, unenforceable, or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions shall not be affected thereby. If any provision is determined to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, you agree to a modification of such provision to provide for enforcement of the provision's intent, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Failure of Id Software or Activision to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of such provision or of the right to enforce such provision. <B>IMMEDIATELY UPON YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH, OR YOUR BREACH OF ANY TERM OR PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOUR LICENSE GRANTED HEREIN AND THIS AGREEMENT AUTOMATICALLY SHALL TERMINATE, WITHOUT NOTICE, AND ID SOFTWARE AND ACTIVISION MAY PURSUE ALL RELIEF AND REMEDIES AGAINST YOU THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW AND/OR THIS AGREEMENT.</B> Immediately upon termination of this Agreement, any and all rights you are granted hereunder shall terminate, you shall have no right to use the Software, the Printed Materials, or the New Creations, in any manner, you immediately shall destroy all copies of the Software, the Printed Materials, and the New Creations in your possession, custody, or control, and all rights granted hereunder shall revert, without notice, to and be vested in Id Software.</P>
