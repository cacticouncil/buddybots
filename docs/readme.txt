2.  CD Key

A. Installation and the CD Key

When installing Doom 3 you will be prompted to enter your CD 
authentication key.  The authentication key appears on the CD 
packaging.  It is important that you enter the key string in its 
entirety exactly as it appears on the CD package.  The Doom 3 Master 
Server verifies the CD key each time you connect for online play.

B. The game tells me my CD key is invalid:

The number one problem with CD keys is mistyping.  Double and triple 
check the characters you have entered.

C. Some common sense about your CD key:

Each CD key is unique - protect it from loss or theft by keeping a copy 
of it in a safe place.  Without it, you cannot reinstall the game or 
play online.  You may hear of so-called "CD Key generators" being 
available for illicit download on the Internet.  They do not work as 
advertised, and often attempt to steal legitimate keys off your 
machine, reveal personal information or install viruses, worms and/or 
trojan horses on your machine.  Do not download and/or use them under 
any circumstances.

3.  DirectX(r) Detection & Installation

The Doom 3 installer does not check for the version of DirectX(r) you 
have currently installed, it just prompts you to install DirectX(r) 
9.0b.  Activision recommends allowing the installer to proceed with the 
DirectX(r) 9.0b installation, even if you think you may have 9.0b 
installed.  Re-installing DirectX(r) 9.0b will not harm your DirectX(r) 
configuration.  Doom 3 requires DirectX(r) 9.0b to install and play.

4. Windows(r) Installer Updates

The Windows(r) Installer may need to be updated.  If this is the case, 
the Doom 3 installer will update the Windows(r) Installer, reboot the 
machine, then continue normally.


TROUBLESHOOTING:

1. Video Issues
Please note that Doom 3 will automatically configure optimal video 
settings based on your computer's hardware.  If your hardware changes 
after install or if you wish to rescan, in the Main Menu: click 
OPTIONS, SYSTEM, then click the SCAN HARDWARE AND SELECT OPTIMAL VIDEO 
QUALITY button, then APPLY CHANGES. Any change in Screen Size and some 
advanced options requires you to quit and restart Doom 3 for them to 
take effect. 

A. Latest drivers required

For best performance and video quality, please make sure you have the 
latest drivers for your video card when running Doom 3.  If you have an 
ATI or NVIDIA video card, you can find drivers on their websites.
http://www.ati.com/
http://www.nvidia.com/


B. Disabling video options to gain performance:

In addition to setting Low Quality, disabling Specular, Bump Maps, and 
Shadows will help improve performance. These can be disabled under the 
ADVANCED OPTIONS of the SYSTEM menu. Please note that while increasing 
performance, disabling these options turns off graphical features that 
are key in the Doom 3 experience.


2. Sound Issues

A. Latest drivers required

Please make sure you have the latest drivers for your sound card when 
running Doom 3.

B. The game tells me I don't have surround sound speakers when I do.

If you have surround sound speakers make sure that you have the correct 
speaker configuration in the Windows(r) control panel and not only in 
any software utilities that came with your sound card. 
For Windows(r) XP: 
Select "Sounds and Audio Devices" in the control panel. On the 
"Volume" tab, click the "Advanced" button under Speaker Settings.  Make 
sure you have the correct speaker configuration chosen in the drop-down 
menu on the "Speakers" tab. 

For Windows(r) 2000: 
Select "Sounds and Multimedia" in the control panel. Click the "Audio" 
tab. Click the "Advanced" button under "Sound Playback".  Make sure the 
correct speaker configuration is chosen under "Speaker Setup".

C.  The sound stutters while playing:

Make sure you have the latest drivers for your sound card. If 
stuttering persists try reducing Hardware Acceleration: Click on Start, 
then Run. Type "dxdiag" and hit enter. This brings up the "DirectX(r) 
Diagnostic Tool". Click on the Sound tab and try reducing the "Hardware 
Sound Acceleration Level" slider.



3. Multiplayer and Internet issues
Please note that Internet play requires a broadband connection and 
latest drivers.

A. Internet listen server vs dedicated server:
   
Hosting a listen server over the Internet is more taxing on your system 
than a dedicated server. Server performance will improve with dedicated 
servers when hosting on the Internet. 

B. Dedicated servers crash on machines with 384mb of RAM.

If you have dedicated server stability issues running on a machine with 
384mb of RAM, try first starting a listen server, disconnecting, then 
starting a dedicated server.  If problems persist try rebooting your 
machine and repeating those steps.

C.  Problems Finding Internet Games

If you are having problems seeing servers in the Multiplayer Game 
Browser screen,  please make sure that you have checked the following 
before contacting customer support.

1) Make sure that you are connected to the Internet (through either a 
Local Area Network, Cable Modem, DSL Modem etc.).  You must connect to 
the Internet before starting the game.

2) Once you have connected to the Internet and started Doom 3, click 
"Multiplayer", then "Find A Multiplayer Game".  In the "Game Browser" 
menu make sure "Internet" is selected. Click on "Get New List". 


NOTE:  Customer Support does not support playing multiplayer 
through firewalls or shared connections.

4. Operating system specific issues

A.  Shift Key in Windows(r) 2000/XP Interrupts Game

If you press the Shift key 5 times consecutively in Windows(r) 2000 or 
Windows(r) XP the following message should appear:

"By pressing the SHIFT key five times you have turned on the StickyKeys 
feature in Windows(r) 2000 [or Windows(r) XP].  With this feature, you 
can lock down the CTRL, ALT, or SHIFT keys.  This is useful if you are 
unable to hold down more than one key at a time.

Click OK to turn this feature on.  If you do not want to use the 
feature, click Cancel.

To avoid this happening in the future, click the Settings button on the 
window referenced above.  When the accessibility options screen 
appears, click the "Settings" button in the "Sticky Keys" portion of 
the window.  On the next window (should be labeled "Settings For Sticky 
Keys"), uncheck in the box that says, "Use shortcut," then click on 
"Apply," and close the windows.  The problem should not occur once the 
shortcut has been disabled.

B.  Windows(r) Key Interrupts Game in 2000/XP

If the Windows(r) key is pressed during game play, the Start Menu will 
interrupt the game.  Should this happen, simply press the Escape (Esc) 
key to close the menu and return to the game.  Unfortunately, there is 
no way to prevent this from happening again except by being careful not 
to hit those keys while playing.

C.  Game Icons Are Missing From Start Menu And/Or Desktop In Windows(r) 
2000/XP

When installing Doom 3 while logged into Windows(r) as a specific user, 
the game icons will only show up when logging in as that user.  For 
example, if you log into Windows(r) as "Joeuser", install the game, 
then log out and log back in as "Janeuser", the game icons will not 
show up.  If you wish to play the game, make sure you log into 
Windows(r) as the same user you were logged in as when you installed 
the game.

D.  Admin Rights Needed To Load and Play On Windows(r) 2000 or XP

If you are running Windows(r) 2000 or Windows(r) XP, you must have 
Administrator rights to properly install and play the game.


DOOM 3 ADDENDUM:

1. ACCESSING THE CONSOLE IN DOOM 3

The Console can be accessed with the CTRL-ALT-TILDE (~) key. Please 
note that use of the console is unsupported by Customer 
Support. Please do not contact Customer Support with console command 
questions.

Note: For ease of use, the console can be set to open with just the 
TILDE (~) key.  To turn this setting on you must enter the following
command:

com_allowConsole 1


2. VOICE COMMANDS IN MULTIPLAYER

Doom 3 multiplayer has the ability to play audio chat lines in-game for 
purposes of taunting, congratulating, or for team-specific requests and 
instructions. In order to utilize this function, keys must be bound to 
them in the console. While this feature is unsupported, we've included 
a CFG file that when executed will bind the key-pad keys to those voice 
commands. 
It can run from the console by typing the following:
exec mp_vchat

Here is a brief description of those bindings and their functions:

3. USING THE EDITOR

Doom 3 comes with the editor and source files built in.  CAUTION: 
loading and saving any of the single or multiplayer levels that come 
with Doom 3 may cause them to no longer function properly.  If this 
happens you will need to uninstall Doom 3, delete the folder and any 
created files, and reinstall Doom 3.
